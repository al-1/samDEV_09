some early but working code to test/use SPI flash. Will get improved to a library version soon.
So far only tested with Macronix MX25L1005 1MBit (or 126kByte) flash
see this [project log](https://hackaday.io/project/12099-samdev09/log/42129-spi-flash-working) of my [project](https://hackaday.io/project/12099) on hackaday.io for more information.
